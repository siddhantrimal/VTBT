VTBT is a Unity 3D based project which allows the user to visit Dharahara in a game-environment. Seeking to re-create the experience of visiting Dharahara in a virtual environment after the 2015 Nepal earthquake, VTBT is a project born in calamity to inspire change. With VTBT, the developers believe that heritage can and should also be preserved virtually by creating and porting a game-environment, such as this, to other platforms such as AR, for the benefit of future generations.
